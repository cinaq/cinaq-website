      <description>Occasionally my auto unlock Mac with Apple watch stops working. There are workaround instructions to &amp;ldquo;repair&amp;rdquo; this issue. One of them involves rebooting both Mac and Apple Watch. Just like you I&amp;rsquo;m not very keen of rebooting my workstation. Deeper into researching I found the unlock feature relies on Bluetooth and Wifi.
So the following steps are needed to reset the auto unlock:
 Open System Preferences Go to Security &amp;amp; Privacy Go to General Uncheck Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac (Step 1) Turn off Bluetooth and then turn it on again (Step 2) Turn off WiFi and then turn it on again (Step 3)     System Preferences</description>

Introduction Automation engineers often have boring tasks. Their job is to automate repetitive tasks. In the early days of Unix and Linux most automation is done with shell scripts. Nowadays we use higher level configuration management systems like Ansible, Puppet, Salt, etc replacing most of the erroneous scripts with poor error handling, lots of boiler code and more importantly high maintenance cost.</description>

      <description>Introduction After 6 years developing Python Flask applications, mainly REST API&amp;rsquo;s, in 2019 I still could not find any good articles about how to develop high value tests for Python Flask based applications. That is going to change today!
First I will give my opinion on testing and methodology, followed by a demo case to illustrate high value testing with actual code. Feel free to skip all the boring reading and head directly over to the code on Github.</description>
