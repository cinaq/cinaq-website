      <description>After 6 years developing Python Flask applications, mainly REST API&amp;rsquo;s, in 2019 I still could not find any good articles about how to develop high value tests for Python Flask based applications. That is going to change today!
First I will give my opinion on testing and methodology, followed by a demo case to illustrate high value testing with actual code. Feel free to skip all the boring reading and head directly over to the code on Github.</description>
