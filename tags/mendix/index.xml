      <description>In the world of technology, efficiency and convenience are paramount. Just like how you would prefer to stay in a luxurious 7-star hotel during your holidays, IT professionals and app developers also seek an environment where everything is taken care of seamlessly. This desire for a hassle-free experience is what makes a low-ops platform akin to a 7-star hotel for apps. While traditional app delivery may resemble renting a low-budget apartment, where you have more freedom but a lot on your plate, a low-ops platform offers a superior alternative.</description>

      <description>Today a client reached out to me with a mysterious case where the build pipeline of his Mendix app started to fail. He has just upgraded his app to Mendix 7.23.33 but was surprised it was not very smooth. As always I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by out-of-ordinary problems. And this one turned out quite interesting.
The error As with most issues, it starts with a huge stacktrace. You can find this stacktrace in the appendix A.</description>

      <description>Mendix introduced the Basic package back in September 2021. It has been one of the most anticipated moves around licensing because there were Free apps, the free tier which mostly enabled hobby projects or newcomers to try out Mendix. The second option was simply: enterprise sales.
With the Basic Package, Mendix tries to close the gap between free and enterprise. Which as you might have guessed would be small businesses, more demanding hobby projects, or startups.</description>

      <description>Recently the first Mendix book was published. It was titled Building Low-Code Applications with Mendix: Discover best practices and expert techniques to simplify enterprise web development by Bryan Kenneweg, Imran Kasam, and Micah McCullen. It guides the reader to become an application developer on the Mendix platform. This book inspired me also to contribute to growing and educating this unique low-code community.
What drives me? I joined the Mendix company in 2012, fresh out of university.</description>

      <description>Over the past 5 years interest in low-code increased 100 folds according to Google Trends: This correlates with human psychology eager to optimise for efficiency in everything and building software solutions is no exception. As programming is becoming easier and more accessible, in the future, anyone should be able solve their own information automation challenges. Low-code is a relatively new movement that tries to enable those citizen developers with the right tooling lowering the barrier to build applications without writing traditional code.</description>
