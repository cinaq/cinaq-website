      <description>Recently the first Mendix book was published. It was titled Building Low-Code Applications with Mendix: Discover best practices and expert techniques to simplify enterprise web development by Bryan Kenneweg, Imran Kasam, and Micah McCullen. It guides the reader to become an application developer on the Mendix platform. This book inspired me also to contribute to growing and educating this unique low-code community.
What drives me? I joined the Mendix company in 2012, fresh out of university.</description>

As programming is becoming easier and more accessible, in the future, anyone should be able solve their own information automation challenges. Low-code is a relatively new movement that tries to enable those citizen developers with the right tooling lowering the barrier to build applications without writing traditional code.</description>
