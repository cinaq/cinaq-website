      <description>Introduction Automation engineers often have boring tasks. Their job is to automate repetitive tasks. In the early days of Unix and Linux most automation is done with shell scripts.

      <description>Introduction We as human beings This article is based on my own personal experiences I would give to myself during my last years of university, around 23 years old. As of this writing time travel is not possible or known to the human race. There are theories on alternative timelines in the universe. For the sake of our sanity we will not address these hypothesis. But nonetheless my story could be the tips here could be useful to others.</description>
