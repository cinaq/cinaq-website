The quest for never-ending efficiency evolved from centralized sysadmin teams to decentralized DevOps, SRE and platforms. All with the ultimate goal to enable rapid value delivery. This is critical in today’s fast-paced world where time to market is crucial for business success.

In this post, we aim to shed light on the implications of this change, not only for our team but also for companies like heroku, fly.</description>

      <description>Today a client reached out to me with a mysterious case where the build pipeline of his Mendix app started to fail. He has just upgraded his app to Mendix 7.23.33 but was surprised it was not very smooth. As always I&amp;rsquo;m intrigued by out-of-ordinary problems. And this one turned out quite interesting.
The error As with most issues, it starts with a huge stacktrace. You can find this stacktrace in the appendix A.</description>

      <description>Mendix introduced the Basic package back in September 2021. It has been one of the most anticipated moves around licensing because there were Free apps, the free tier which mostly enabled hobby projects or newcomers to try out Mendix. The second option was simply: enterprise sales.
With the Basic Package, Mendix tries to close the gap between free and enterprise. Which as you might have guessed would be small businesses, more demanding hobby projects, or startups.</description>

      <description>Recently the first Mendix book was published. It was titled Building Low-Code Applications with Mendix: Discover best practices and expert techniques to simplify enterprise web development by Bryan Kenneweg, Imran Kasam, and Micah McCullen. It guides the reader to become an application developer on the Mendix platform. This book inspired me also to contribute to growing and educating this unique low-code community.
What drives me? I joined the Mendix company in 2012, fresh out of university.</description>
